# Managing Users

User management is the capability for sourcing organization administrators to:&#x20;

a) enrol users&#x20;

b) assign users with appropriate roles for open and live sourcing projects that they manage&#x20;

Every project that is launched by the sourcing organization needs users who are competent to review, approve or reject contributions received for the project.&#x20;

For example, if a sourcing organization launched a set of projects to seek content for a program. Each project will need a set of reviewers to review the contributions made, and either approve or reject them. Reviewers may not necessarily be part of the sourcing organization. The organization has the choice to involve experts to ensure quality content.&#x20;

### User Roles&#x20;

a) Administrator&#x20;
