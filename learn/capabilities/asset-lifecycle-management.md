# Asset Lifecycle Management

There are various micro-services to manage the lifecycle of an asset, depending on the type of asset. For ex., assets of type content are enabled by the content services, collections by the collection services and question sets by the question and question set services. The key capability enabled by all these micro-services is '**End-to-end publishing**' process.&#x20;

These microservices that allow you to: ****&#x20;

* Create, collaborate, curate & publish assets.&#x20;
* Easily scale as per your needs.
* Unbundle the microservices to create different solutions using the same set of microservices.
